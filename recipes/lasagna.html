    <ul>
        <li>9 precooked lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>500 g (1.1 lb) ground beef (or pork)</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, grated</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>200 g (7 oz) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>200 g (7 oz) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until golden and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned and cooked through. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon while cooking.</li>
        <li>Add the grated carrot to the skillet and cook for a few minutes until tender.</li>
        <li>Pour the crushed tomatoes into the skillet and mix well. Add the dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook over medium-low heat for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with half of the grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat mixture. Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top. Then, add a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture and sprinkle some shredded mozzarella cheese over it.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process, alternating layers of meat, lasagna noodles, and ricotta cheese, until all the ingredients are used. Be sure to finish with a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining grated Parmesan cheese over the top layer.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then, remove the aluminum foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing into portions and serving.</li>
    </ol>
